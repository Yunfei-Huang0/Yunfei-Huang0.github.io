title: Monte Carlo Tree Search & AlphaGo (Zero)
event: ORTEC Algorithmic Meetings
event_url: 
location: ORTEC Office, Zoetermeer
summary: Talk about Monte Carlo Tree Search & AlphaGo for ORTEC Algorithmic meetings.
abstract: "AlphaGo, a variant of (Monte Carlo) Tree Search which uses Deep Neural Networks to guide the search process, is the self-learning algorithm used by Google Deepmind to write history by beating the world champion in the game of Go. For a slightly hyped introduction, see the trailer at https://www.alphagomovie.com/. For the facts, read the paper (link at the bottom of https://deepmind.com/blog/alphago-zero-learning-scratch/). In this lecture, we will look beyond the hype and discuss the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm and the AlphaGo (Zero) variant, to see what really enabled this breakthrough."
